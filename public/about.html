<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi there! I'm Soma RÃ¶vid and I've always been interested in the IT industry.
  Recently, I've discovered that I'm more passionate about software development
  than computer repair and networking. I'm now taking a full-stack developer course,
  which I've been wanting to do for some time but never had the courage until now!
  Before learning to code, I worked as a Customer Service Representative, a Dispatcher,
  and a Logistics Administrator.
